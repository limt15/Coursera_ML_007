You've seen Mathematica in action, but I'd like to share with you 
how the new cloud integration will help you utilize Mathematica 
even more. I'm writing to personally invite you to our Virtual 
Conference on November 13 and bring your attention to the 
featured talk on Mathematica Online.

Mathematica Online allows you to work on projects when you travel 
or work from home, which can sometimes be difficult using 
desktop-only software. Because Mathematica Online runs in any web 
browser, you can access it on any laptop, desktop machine, 
tablet, or other device with internet accessibility. With the 
included cloud storage, you can easily start a project on your 
desktop license and then continue working elsewhere in 
Mathematica Online.

Here's the specific talk information--it's part of conference 
Track #1:
An Introduction to Mathematica Online
November 13, 1:30pm-2pm Eastern

If you'd like to discuss how to get Mathematica Online or want 
additional details on the talk, please don't hesitate to let me 
know.

Best,
